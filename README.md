messenger "i" or "intelligent" uses python curses to update and display information

messenger "e" or "efficient" uses no graphics at all and is meant to be as fast as possible and is compatible with mobile

messenger server is compatible with all clients within its version (all 1.* clients will work with a 1.* server)

encrypt is not being used

id importer can be used to associate an IP address with a user-supplied ID so you dont have to keep retyping the IP. for messenger_intelligent you can run the id importer seperate

for easy setup just download the 7z file.

COMMANDS:

Commands starting with a "#" are local and not seen by the server or anyone else. as of version 1.0 there are only 2 and im working on more

#help, #exit, #import (effecient only)

#exit will exit the application without errors. probably

Commands starting with a "server.main." are seen and proccessed by the server and not other clients

bug-report: , get-users, get-link, help, get-contact

bug reports go to the server, make sure to put the ":"

If you need to show a command to somebody, any presence of a double quotation ' " ' will make the server ignore the command and send it as a normal message
